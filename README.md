# Console based Parallel-Image-Processor
This is a console based Parallel Image Processor was intially written for Linux ,but I later decided to rewrite it for Windows while using the pthreads library instead of pthreads-win32 library. As a result, there might be some bugs ,but the programs works flawlessly. <br>
Please bear in mind that all the images that are to be processed must be in the Resources folder or else you would have to give the entire path. <br>
All outputs are stored in the Edits folder which is in the Resources folder.
